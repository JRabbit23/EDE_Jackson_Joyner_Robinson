# Rationale and Research Questions

To conduct a preliminary exploration of the ways in which the political systems and the electricity grid coexist, our team has formulated the following research questions:

  1) What is the relationship between the percent penetration of renewable technology (i.e.,     solar, wind) and state governor (using the political affiliation of the state governor as     a proxy for a stateâ€™s political leanings) in a given year / over a period of time?
  
  2) Has renewable penetration grown in any states that have had a single-party governor over     a longer period of time?

# Dataset Information
This dataset was prepared in Fall 2023 as a final project for Environmental Data Analytics (ENV 872) at Duke University's Nicholas School of the Environment.

The repository contains 10 years of data (2010-2020) detailing the United State's renewable energy generation capacity by governing state political party. There are three main categories for our dataset. They are:
1) eGRID plant data with coordinates
2) US state governor data by party and year
3) State geographic boundaries shapefile

# results
#The x variable is "number of years a Democratic governor was in office" and the y variable is "Total nameplate capacity from renewable energy sources".
# Ho: There is no relationship between renewable capacity and the number of years a Democratic governor was in office.
#Given the R-squared value, around virtually none of the variability in total nameplate capacity from renewable energy sources is explained by the number of years a Democratic governor was in office. Given the high p-value of 0.9239, we fail to reject H0. Thus, there is no relationship between renewable capacity and the number of years a Democratic governor was in office.

# The calculated correlation coefficient between the two variables is approximately -0.014, which suggests a very weak relationship between the variables x and y. Moreover, the high p-value means that we fail to reject the null hypothesis (that there is no correlation). Thus, it appears that there is no significant correlation between the variables.

\newpage

# Summary and Conclusions
#In summary, as it relates to the first research question, there is no apparent relationship #between the percent penetration of renewable energy technologies and state governor over the #period from 2010 - 2020. 
#There are a number of important caveats to make here -- renewable energy development #depends on many factors ranging from federal incentives to state-level renewable portfolio #standards to local zoning ordinances and regulations. Moreover, the dynamics of power markets #/ grid operators (e.g., investor-owned / vertically integrated / non-competitive markets such as #in the southeast versus competitive markets such as ERCOT in Texas) are critically influential, #particularly for the process of interconnection.
#While this project has led to some preliminary, high-level conclusions, it leads to a number of questions for further exploration: 
#	1. What is the magnitude of changes in renewables in the three example states of California (Democratic governor for the entire time period of interest), Texas (Republican governor for the entire time period of interest), and North Carolina (both Democratic and Republican governors for the time period of interest)?
#	2. How do local (e.g., country-level) politics influence renewable energy generation by sub-region of states?
